(She Walketh Veiled and Sleeping,Charlotte Perkins Gilman)
She walketh veiled and sleeping,For she knoweth not her power;She obeyeth but the pleadingOf her heart, and the high leadingOf her soul, unto this hour.Slow advancing, halting, creeping,Comes the Woman to the hour!â€”She walketh veiled and sleeping,For she knoweth not her power.
