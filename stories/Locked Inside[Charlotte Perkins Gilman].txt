(Locked Inside,Charlotte Perkins Gilman)
She beats upon her bolted door,With faint weak hands;Drearily walks the narrow floor;Sullenly sits, blank walls before;Despairing stands. Life calls her, Duty, Pleasure, Gain—Her dreams respond;But the blank daylights wax and wane,Dull peace, sharp agony, slow pain—No hope beyond. Till she comes a thought! She lifts her head,The world grows wide!A voice—as if clear words were said—“Your door, O long imprisonéd,Is locked inside!”
