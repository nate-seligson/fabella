(Praise the Generous Gods,William Ernest Henley)
Praise the generous gods for giving   In a world of wrath and strifeWith a little time for living,   Unto all the joy of life. At whatever source we drink it,   Art or love or faith or wine,In whatever terms we think it,   It is common and divine. Praise the high gods, for in giving   This to man, and this alone,They have made his chance of living   Shine the equal of their own.
